# Curvilinear Grids

Curvilinear grids look just like rectilinear grids, except that the arrangement of points does not follow straight lines anymore. This is often the effect of expressing the sampling points in a different projection.

Since the grid points don't stay on the coordinate axes anymore, we need to store the coordinates as two 2D arrays.
