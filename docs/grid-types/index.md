# Geospatial grids

In the geosciences, a lot of data describes continuous surfaces and is stored in a discretized form (as a lot of real numbers that contain the evaluation at certain sampling points). In the following, we'll call the choice of where to evaluate these surfaces a "grid".

## Grid Types

Various kinds grids exist, but can be broadly divided into 4 categories:

- rectilinear grids
- curvilinear grids
- discrete global grid systems (DGGS)
- unstructured grids
